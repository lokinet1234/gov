                        <h2>Introduction: Weaponized Justice</h2>
                        <p>This case presents a clear pattern of prosecutorial misconduct and abuse of process stemming from the plaintiff’s deliberate concealment of exculpatory evidence and manipulation of legal proceedings. The defendant’s constitutional rights were systematically violated.</p>
                        <blockquote>"Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it."</blockquote>

                        <h2>I. Malicious Prosecution & The Architecture of Deception</h2>
                        <h3>1.1 Prosecutorial Misconduct and Brady Violations</h3>
                        <p>Under <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>, the prosecution bears an absolute constitutional duty to disclose all material exculpatory evidence. The defendant’s documented prior reports of abuse by the plaintiff constitute quintessential Brady material.</p>
                        
                        <h3>1.2 The Half-Truth as a Lie</h3>
                        <p>The plaintiff’s selective presentation of evidence—presenting misleading half-truths while concealing exculpatory facts—vitiates any claim of probable cause. As Prosser & Keeton note, "half of the truth may amount to a lie if it is understood to be the whole."</p>

                    <section id="due-process">
                        <h2>II. The Annihilation of Due Process</h2>
                        <p>The conduct of the hearings fell far short of providing a meaningful opportunity to be heard, creating a proceeding "totally lacking in notice."</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Jurisdictional Defect:</strong> A Commissioner presided over contested matters without the required stipulation from both parties, rendering all orders void.</li>
                            <li><strong>Violation of Notice:</strong> Plaintiff petitioned for two full trials before the defendant had any knowledge of the proceedings.</li>

                    <section id="first-amendment">
                        <h2>III. The Silencing of Dissent</h2>
                        <p>"The freedom to challenge official action without risking arrest distinguishes a free nation from a police state." To justify prohibition of speech, the state must show more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort of an unpopular viewpoint.</p>
