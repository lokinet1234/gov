            <div class="section-content">
                <p>A fundamental pillar of due process is an arbiter with proper legal authority. When a Commissioner presides over a contested matter without the stipulation of both parties, they act without jurisdiction, rendering all orders void. This, combined with a failure to provide adequate notice or a meaningful hearing, constitutes a profound constitutional failure.</p>

                <p>The Defendant was targeted for prosecution in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, based on the desire to prevent the exercise of constitutional rights. The duty of a prosecutor is not to win a case, but to see that justice is done. When the law is applied with an unequal hand, the indictment must be dismissed.</p>

                <p>The oppressed are often forced to educate their oppressors, a diversion of energy from their own survival. A victim is not permitted to simply express anger; they must produce "constructive solutions." If they cannot, their right to critique the abuse is denied, reinforcing the perpetrator's false narrative.</p>
